# Algorithm Visualization

This is a search algorithm visualization on a 2D grid to reach from a start node to an end node. The algorithms are Breadth First Search (BFS), Greedy Best-first search (greedybfs)
and A* (astar).

The first left-click will be the start node with the 2nd  being the target. To erase, use right click.

The blue blocks indicate walls with peach being the start and violet being the target. Red indicates nodes that were visited and green for which neighbors were checked for.
