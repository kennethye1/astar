# Algorithm Visualization

This is a search algorithm visualization on a 2D grid to reach from a start node to an end node. The algorithms are Breadth First Search (BFS), Greedy Best-first search (greedybfs)
and A* (astar).

The first left-click will be the start node with the 2nd  being the target. To erase, use right click.

Press 'g' to use greedybfs, 'b' for BFS, 'space' for A* and to clear and reset everything, press 'c'.
